package org.xtrms.regex

*xtrms* is pronounced "extremis".

The pre-built xtrms.jar file is here in the same directory as this README.

Sources and tests are included. To build, use ant: <http://ant.apache.org>.
Need version 1.7 or so, or later.

You will also need junit: <http://www.junit.org/>
The xtrms project hasn't been tested with the latest version; still using 3.8.2:
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/junit/files/junit/3.8.2/junit3.8.2.zip/download>

You have to tell ant where junit is. Two ways: 
	- define envirionment variable JUNIT_HOME to point to the directory where
	  junit.jar is found
	- define an ant property on the ant command line: 
	  for example, if junit.jar is in /usr/lib/junit_3.8.2, then on the ant 
	  command line, add
		-Djunit.home=/usr/lib/junit_3.8.2

Simple running ant in the current directory

	$ ant 

will rebuild the jar, and re-run the tests.

To see a list of build options, run ant with the projecthelp option:

	$ ant -projecthelp

Unicode: there is a text file in the unicode/ directory:

	unicode.txt.zip

This file contains data on unicode categories, blocks, etc. If you need to 
patch something, unzip it, edit it, and then run the main() method of the
RegexParser.java class. This will rebuild three pre-built tables of char class
objects stored in serialized form. There is no need to re-zip the unicode.txt
file.

Logging: the package uses the standard java logging API to help eliminate
external dependencies. The logging.properties file is at the top level
project directory. There is _very_ hacked up XHTML logging option which I've
not documented yet; it needs to be cleaned up. If you're ambitious, and you
have ATT's GraphViz installed, you can make very pretty log files. Making
this less fragile is TODO.

The rest should be self explanatory. (E.g. javadoc is in the doc/ directory).
